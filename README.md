# Extended Turtle Trading Stock Screener

- **Signal 1 (20-day):** Buy when price breaks above 20-day high, exit when below 10-day low
- **Signal 2 (55-day):** Buy when price breaks above 55-day high, exit when below 20-day low

## ‚öôÔ∏è Signal Logic

### Entry Signals

**Signal 1: 20-Day Breakout**
- **Entry**: Today's close > highest close of past 20 days
- **Exit**: Price falls below lowest close of past 10 days
- **Use Case**: Faster signals, more frequent trades

**Signal 2: 55-Day Breakout (11 weeks)**  
- **Entry**: Today's close > highest close of past 55 days
- **Exit**: Price falls below lowest close of past 20 days
- **Use Case**: Longer-term trends, fewer but stronger signals

self.signal2_exit_period = 20     # Signal 2: 20-day exit

# Volume filters
self.krx_min_volume = 100_000     # KRX minimum volume
self.us_min_volume = 200_000      # US minimum volume

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Warnings

### Important Disclaimers
- **Educational Purpose**: This screener is for educational and research purposes only
- **Not Financial Advice**: Signals are technical indicators, not investment recommendations
- **Trend Following Risks**: Turtle Trading can experience extended drawdown periods
- **Whipsaw Risk**: False breakouts can trigger signals that quickly reverse
- **Market Conditions**: Works best in trending markets, struggles in sideways action

### Turtle Trading Characteristics
- **Drawdowns**: Historical Turtle systems experienced 50%+ drawdowns
- **Win Rate**: Typically 40-50% winning trades, profits from large winners
- **Psychological Challenge**: Requires discipline to follow mechanical rules
- **Market Dependency**: Performance varies significantly across different market regimes

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **Open Source**: All code is publicly visible on GitHub
- **No Authentication**: Uses free, public Yahoo Finance API
- **Static Hosting**: No server-side processing or user data collection
- **Safe Dependencies**: Only established, audited Python packages

## üö® Troubleshooting

**No signals appearing?**
- Data processing problems - solve with pykrx + api call time delay
- Check during high volatility periods for more breakouts

**Workflow not running?**
- Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Check for proper YAML syntax in workflow file

**Different results between runs?**
- Market data updates continuously during trading hours
- Breakout levels change as new daily highs/lows form
- This is normal behavior for real-time trading systems

- Past performance does not predict future results
- Market conditions change and strategies may become less effective

**Always:**
- Conduct thorough research before making investment decisions
- Consider your risk tolerance and financial situation
- Consult with qualified financial professionals
- Never invest money you cannot afford to lose
- Understand that all trading involves risk of loss

The original Turtle Traders were selected and trained professionals trading with substantial capital and sophisticated risk management. Retail implementation requires careful consideration of these factors.
