# Extended Turtle Trading Stock Screener

A fully automated stock screener implementing Extended Turtle Trading signals that runs entirely on GitHub infrastructure, monitoring both Korean (KRX) and US stock markets with real-time breakout detection hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🐢 What is Turtle Trading?

The Turtle Trading system is a trend-following strategy based on breakout signals. This screener implements an extended version with two complementary signal types:

- **Signal 1 (20-day):** Buy when price breaks above 20-day high, exit when below 10-day low
- **Signal 2 (55-day):** Buy when price breaks above 55-day high, exit when below 20-day low

## 📊 Live Demo

Visit the live screener: `https://PJH-02.github.io/stock_screener`

## ⚙️ Signal Logic

### Entry Signals

**Signal 1: 20-Day Breakout**
- **Entry**: Today's close > highest close of past 20 days
- **Exit**: Price falls below lowest close of past 10 days
- **Use Case**: Faster signals, more frequent trades

**Signal 2: 55-Day Breakout (11 weeks)**  
- **Entry**: Today's close > highest close of past 55 days
- **Exit**: Price falls below lowest close of past 20 days
- **Use Case**: Longer-term trends, fewer but stronger signals

### Market-Specific Filters

| Market | Price Filter | Volume Filter | Currency |
|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **KRX** | ≥ ₩5,000 | ≥ 100,000 shares (20d avg) | Korean Won |
| **US** | ≥ $5.00 | ≥ 200,000 shares (20d avg) | US Dollar |

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Modifying Signal Parameters
Edit parameters in `run_screener.py`:
```python
# Turtle Trading parameters
self.signal1_entry_period = 20    # Signal 1: 20-day breakout
self.signal1_exit_period = 10     # Signal 1: 10-day exit
self.signal2_entry_period = 55    # Signal 2: 55-day breakout  
self.signal2_exit_period = 20     # Signal 2: 20-day exit

# Volume filters
self.krx_min_volume = 100_000     # KRX minimum volume
self.us_min_volume = 200_000      # US minimum volume
```

### Scheduling Changes
Modify the GitHub Actions schedule:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/15 14-21 * * 1-5'  # Every 15 min during market hours
```

## 🚨 Trading Signal Interpretation

### Signal 1 (20-day) - Short-term Momentum
- **Entry Signal**: Price breaks above 20-day high → Potential short-term uptrend
- **Exit Signal**: Price breaks below 20-day low → Short-term downtrend
- **Stop Loss**: 10-day low for positions opened on Signal 1 entry
- **Characteristics**: More frequent signals, faster response to market changes

### Signal 2 (55-day) - Long-term Trend
- **Entry Signal**: Price breaks above 55-day high → Strong long-term momentum
- **Stop Loss**: 20-day low for positions opened on Signal 2 entry  
- **Characteristics**: Fewer but potentially more reliable signals, follows major trends

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Original Turtle rules suggest 1-2% risk per position
- **Multiple Signals**: A stock can have both Signal 1 and Signal 2 active simultaneously
- **Exit Discipline**: Each signal type has its own exit rules - follow them strictly

## 🛡️ Risk Warnings

### Important Disclaimers
- **Educational Purpose**: This screener is for educational and research purposes only
- **Not Financial Advice**: Signals are technical indicators, not investment recommendations
- **Trend Following Risks**: Turtle Trading can experience extended drawdown periods
- **Whipsaw Risk**: False breakouts can trigger signals that quickly reverse
- **Market Conditions**: Works best in trending markets, struggles in sideways action

### Turtle Trading Characteristics
- **Drawdowns**: Historical Turtle systems experienced 50%+ drawdowns
- **Win Rate**: Typically 40-50% winning trades, profits from large winners
- **Psychological Challenge**: Requires discipline to follow mechanical rules
- **Market Dependency**: Performance varies significantly across different market regimes

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Open Source**: All code is publicly visible on GitHub
- **No Authentication**: Uses free, public Yahoo Finance API
- **Static Hosting**: No server-side processing or user data collection
- **Safe Dependencies**: Only established, audited Python packages

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**No signals appearing?**
- Data processing problems - solve with pykrx + api call time delay
- Check during high volatility periods for more breakouts

**Workflow not running?**
- Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Check for proper YAML syntax in workflow file

**Different results between runs?**
- Market data updates continuously during trading hours
- Breakout levels change as new daily highs/lows form
- This is normal behavior for real-time trading systems

## ⚠️ Final Disclaimer

**This is a technical analysis tool for educational purposes only.** 

The Turtle Trading system, while historically successful, involves significant risks:
- Large potential drawdowns (50%+ historically documented)
- Requires substantial capital and risk management discipline  
- Past performance does not predict future results
- Market conditions change and strategies may become less effective

**Always:**
- Conduct thorough research before making investment decisions
- Consider your risk tolerance and financial situation
- Consult with qualified financial professionals
- Never invest money you cannot afford to lose
- Understand that all trading involves risk of loss

The original Turtle Traders were selected and trained professionals trading with substantial capital and sophisticated risk management. Retail implementation requires careful consideration of these factors.
