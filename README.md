# Extended Turtle Trading Stock Screener

A fully automated stock screener implementing Extended Turtle Trading signals that runs entirely on GitHub infrastructure, monitoring both Korean (KRX) and US stock markets with real-time breakout detection hosted on GitHub Pages.

## üê¢ What is Turtle Trading?

The Turtle Trading system is a trend-following strategy based on breakout signals. This screener implements an extended version with two complementary signal types:

- **Signal 1 (20-day):** Buy when price breaks above 20-day high, exit when below 10-day low
- **Signal 2 (55-day):** Buy when price breaks above 55-day high, exit when below 20-day low

## ‚öôÔ∏è Signal Logic

### Entry Signals

**Signal 1: 20-Day Breakout**
- **Entry**: Today's close > highest close of past 20 days
- **Exit**: Price falls below lowest close of past 10 days
- **Use Case**: Faster signals, more frequent trades

**Signal 2: 55-Day Breakout (11 weeks)**  
- **Entry**: Today's close > highest close of past 55 days
- **Exit**: Price falls below lowest close of past 20 days
- **Use Case**: Longer-term trends, fewer but stronger signals

### Market-Specific Filters

|--------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **KRX** | ‚â• ‚Ç©5,000 | ‚â• 100,000 shares (20d avg) | Korean Won |

## üîß Customization Options

### Modifying Signal Parameters
Edit parameters in `run_screener.py`:
```python
# Turtle Trading parameters
self.signal1_entry_period = 20    # Signal 1: 20-day breakout
self.signal1_exit_period = 10     # Signal 1: 10-day exit
self.signal2_entry_period = 55    # Signal 2: 55-day breakout  
self.signal2_exit_period = 20     # Signal 2: 20-day exit

# Volume filters
self.krx_min_volume = 100_000     # KRX minimum volume
self.us_min_volume = 200_000      # US minimum volume
```

### Adding More Stocks
Expand the ticker universe in `get_ticker_universe()`:
```python
# Add KRX stocks
krx_tickers = [
    '005930.KS',  # Samsung Electronics
    'YOUR_TICKER.KS',  # Add your KRX ticker here
]

# Add US stocks  
us_tickers = [
    'AAPL', 'MSFT',
    'YOUR_TICKER',  # Add your US ticker here
]
```

### Scheduling Changes
Modify the GitHub Actions schedule:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/15 14-21 * * 1-5'  # Every 15 min during market hours
```

## üö® Trading Signal Interpretation

### Signal 1 (20-day) - Short-term Momentum
- **Entry Signal**: Price breaks above 20-day high ‚Üí Potential short-term uptrend
- **Exit Signal**: Price breaks below 20-day low ‚Üí Short-term downtrend
- **Stop Loss**: 10-day low for positions opened on Signal 1 entry
- **Characteristics**: More frequent signals, faster response to market changes

### Signal 2 (55-day) - Long-term Trend
- **Entry Signal**: Price breaks above 55-day high ‚Üí Strong long-term momentum
- **Stop Loss**: 20-day low for positions opened on Signal 2 entry  
- **Characteristics**: Fewer but potentially more reliable signals, follows major trends

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Original Turtle rules suggest 1-2% risk per position
- **Multiple Signals**: A stock can have both Signal 1 and Signal 2 active simultaneously
- **Exit Discipline**: Each signal type has its own exit rules - follow them strictly

## üìà Performance Considerations

### System Performance
- **Processing Time**: ~18 seconds for 67 stocks (KRX + US combined)
- **API Efficiency**: 1 call per ticker, built-in retry logic
- **Data Volume**: 200 days √ó 67 tickers = ~13,400 data points per run
- **Update Frequency**: Every 15 minutes during market hours

### GitHub Limitations
- **Execution Time**: 6-hour maximum per job (far more than needed)
- **API Rate Limits**: Yahoo Finance free tier, respectful usage
- **Storage**: Static JSON files, minimal repository growth
- **Concurrent Jobs**: Limited to prevent resource abuse

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Warnings

### Important Disclaimers
- **Educational Purpose**: This screener is for educational and research purposes only
- **Not Financial Advice**: Signals are technical indicators, not investment recommendations
- **Trend Following Risks**: Turtle Trading can experience extended drawdown periods
- **Whipsaw Risk**: False breakouts can trigger signals that quickly reverse
- **Market Conditions**: Works best in trending markets, struggles in sideways action

### Turtle Trading Characteristics
- **Drawdowns**: Historical Turtle systems experienced 50%+ drawdowns
- **Win Rate**: Typically 40-50% winning trades, profits from large winners
- **Psychological Challenge**: Requires discipline to follow mechanical rules
- **Market Dependency**: Performance varies significantly across different market regimes

## üîê Security & Privacy

- **Open Source**: All code is publicly visible on GitHub
- **No Authentication**: Uses free, public Yahoo Finance API
- **Static Hosting**: No server-side processing or user data collection
- **Safe Dependencies**: Only established, audited Python packages

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No signals appearing?**
- Turtle signals are less frequent than other indicators
- Check during high volatility periods for more breakouts
- Verify both KRX and US market hours overlap

**Workflow not running?**
- Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Check for proper YAML syntax in workflow file
- Verify the schedule aligns with market hours (UTC time)

**Data loading errors?**
- Yahoo Finance API occasionally experiences downtime
- Check network connectivity and API rate limits
- Look for error details in GitHub Actions logs

**Different results between runs?**
- Market data updates continuously during trading hours
- Breakout levels change as new daily highs/lows form
- This is normal behavior for real-time trading systems

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Disclaimer

**This is a technical analysis tool for educational purposes only.** 

The Turtle Trading system, while historically successful, involves significant risks:
- Large potential drawdowns (50%+ historically documented)
- Requires substantial capital and risk management discipline  
- Past performance does not predict future results
- Market conditions change and strategies may become less effective

**Always:**
- Conduct thorough research before making investment decisions
- Consider your risk tolerance and financial situation
- Consult with qualified financial professionals
- Never invest money you cannot afford to lose
- Understand that all trading involves risk of loss

The original Turtle Traders were selected and trained professionals trading with substantial capital and sophisticated risk management. Retail implementation requires careful consideration of these factors.# Golden Cross Stock Screener

    }
  ]
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not running?**
- Check Actions are enabled in repository Settings
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Look for syntax errors in the YAML file

**GitHub Pages not working?**
- Enable Pages in Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Set source to "Deploy from a branch" ‚Üí `main` ‚Üí `/public`
- Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment

**No data showing?**
- Check the workflow logs in Actions tab
- Verify `tickers.txt` contains valid symbols
- Ensure Python dependencies are correct

**Data not updating?**
- Workflow only runs during market hours (Mon-Fri, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)
- Manual trigger available via Actions ‚Üí "Run workflow"
- Check for API rate limiting from Yahoo Finance

### GitHub Actions Limitations

- **Safe dependencies**: Only well-established Python packages

## üìä Performance Metrics

The system typically processes:
- **35 stocks** in ~12 seconds
- **API calls**: 1 per ticker (35 total)
- **Data volume**: ~252 days √ó 35 tickers = 8,820 data points
- **Output size**: ~2-5KB JSON file
- **Update frequency**: Every 15 minutes during market hours

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Multi-timeframe Analysis
The system tracks Golden Cross signals across different timeframes:
- **1-day lookback**: Most recent crosses
- **3-day lookback**: Recent pattern confirmation
- **Historical tracking**: Date of actual crossover

### Statistical Insights
- **Success rate**: Percentage of tickers successfully analyzed
- **Processing metrics**: Execution time and error tracking
- **Market coverage**: Total stocks monitored

### Error Resilience
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries for API failures
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing despite individual failures
